# OpenPlus Live Site

This is a Bootstrap theme, premised on Landkit Theme by Good Themes.
We point GitHub Pages dorectly to the /dist folder, which is automatically generated (regenerated) everytime you run - npm run build. So the entire site is managed from /src. The npm will regenerate all common partials (re: headers footers, and recompile SCSS). 

### Documentation

Development documentation is available at `src/html/docs/index.html` (or `dist/docs/index.html` once you've compiled), or visit http://landkit.goodthemes.co/docs/index.html.

### Getting Started

The steps to compile and get started with development are covered in detail in documentation mentioned above, but the summary is:

- npm install
- npm start

We provide an "unofficial" Landkit Figma file for you to play with. Learn more about it at https://www.figma.com/file/e6SElg0s79XUTzHfvJkbhV/LandKit-2.0.0-beta-Distsributed?node-id=2016%3A15971.
